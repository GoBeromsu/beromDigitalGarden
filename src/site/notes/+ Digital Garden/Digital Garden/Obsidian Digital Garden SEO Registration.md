# Digital Garden SEO Registration
## Intro
After building my Digital Garden with Obsidian, the next step is to register it with Google Search Console. The reason for this is to make my little digital sanctuary known to the Google search engine.

## Process

When you first visit Google Search Console, you have the option to register using a domain or URL prefix. Since I own a domain, I entered www.berom.net and clicked 'Continue'.

If you own a domain, you can complete the registration process easily!

To verify domain ownership, you need to add a specific key to your DNS records. This involves adding a TXT record to your DNS settings. This can be done on the site where you purchased your domain.

In my case, since Google Domains was no longer available, I switched to using SquareSpace. Therefore, I had to go to SquareSpace's domain settings.

In the custom records settings, set hosts to '@', type to 'TXT', and then enter the key you received earlier into the Data field before saving. Afterwards, return to Google Search Console to complete the ownership verification, and the registration process is finished!

## Tips

### What is a DNS TXT Record?
A DNS TXT record is a method of adding textual information to a domain's DNS settings. While it serves various purposes, it is primarily used for domain ownership verification, setting email sending policies, and providing other server configuration information. When authenticating your domain with Google Search Console, you'll be asked to add a specific 'key' to a TXT record. This is one of the methods Google uses to verify domain ownership.

### SEO Benefits
Registering your Digital Garden with Google Search Console brings several SEO benefits:
- **Improved Search Visibility:** Allows Google to easily crawl and index your site, helping you achieve higher rankings in search results.
- **Keyword Optimization Insights:** Analyzes which keywords visitors use to reach your site, enabling you to refine your content strategy.
- **Site Issue Diagnostics:** Google Search Console identifies crawling errors, mobile usability issues, etc., providing opportunities to enhance user experience.

In summary, adding a DNS TXT record is a crucial step in verifying domain ownership, and registering your site with Google Search Console is essential for enhancing search visibility and SEO performance. Prepare your Digital Garden to be discovered by a wider audience! üåêüå∏
