# Crafting a Robust WindowManager in Electron: Enhancing App Architecture

In the realm of Electron development, managing multiple windows efficiently is a common hurdle that developers encounter. This challenge becomes especially pronounced in complex applications where inter-window communication and data management are pivotal. The traditional approach of independently managing each window often leads t1o increased complexity and maintenance challenges. Recognizing these pitfalls, we embarked on a journey to streamline this process through the creation of a centralized WindowManager. This blog post delves into the motivations, design, and benefits of this architectural enhancement, offering insights into how it can revolutionize your Electron application development.

## The Genesis of WindowManager

Initially, our Electron TSX project treated each window as a separate entity. While this approach seemed straightforward at first, it quickly unraveled as the application's complexity grew. The primary challenge was the cumbersome process of managing data transmission and state synchronization between windows, which was both error-prone and inefficient. Moreover, this scattered approach to window management compounded the difficulty of maintaining the application, leading to a pivotal realization: a centralized system was imperative for sustainable development.

## Designing the WindowManager

The WindowManager in an Electron application serves as a centralized control system for managing multiple windows, enhancing data flow, and improving overall application maintainability. Below, we'll dissect the core functionalities and design principles embedded within the WindowManager code, illuminating how it addresses common challenges in Electron development.

### Core Features and Functions

The `WindowManager` class is crafted with several key objectives in mind:

- **Centralized Window Creation and Management:** It encapsulates all logic related to the lifecycle of windows within the application. This includes creating, managing, and disposing of both the main window and any auxiliary windows, thereby fostering a cohesive and organized structure.

- **Efficient Data Transmission:** By centralizing window management, the WindowManager facilitates smoother data exchange and synchronization between windows. This design choice streamlines communication within the application, ensuring that data flows seamlessly across different parts of the system.

- **Lifecycle Management:** The WindowManager meticulously handles window lifecycle events. This approach ensures that resources are efficiently managed, and windows are gracefully handled throughout the application's runtime, minimizing resource leakage and enhancing performance.

### Code Breakdown

```typescript
import {app, BrowserWindow, screen, desktopCapturer} from 'electron';
import {join} from 'node:path';
import {onCaptureAreaPosted} from './constants';
import {fileURLToPath} from 'node:url';

class WindowManager {
  private mainWindow: BrowserWindow | null = null;
  private captureWindows: BrowserWindow[] = [];
  private thumbnails: Map<number, Electron.NativeImage> = new Map();

  private windowSettings = {
    frame: false,
    transparent: true,
    alwaysOnTop: true,
    fullscreen: true,
    kiosk: true,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
      contextIsolation: true,
      preload: join(app.getAppPath(), 'packages/preload/dist/index.mjs'),
    },
  };

  constructor() {
    this.restoreOrCreateMainWindow = this.restoreOrCreateMainWindow.bind(this);
  }

  public async createMainWindow(): Promise<void> {
    // Code to create the main application window
  }

  public async createCaptureWindows() {
    // Code to create windows for capturing different displays
  }

  private async findDisplaySource(display: Electron.Display) {
    // Code to find the source for a display
  }

  private async createCaptureWindowForDisplay(display: Electron.Display, thumbnail: Electron.NativeImage) {
    // Code to create a capture window for a specific display
  }

  public async restoreOrCreateMainWindow(): Promise<void> {
    // Code to restore or create the main window if it doesn't exist or is destroyed
  }

  getThumbnailByWindowId(windowId: number) {
    // Retrieves a thumbnail for a given window ID
  }

  closeCaptureWindow() {
    // Closes all capture windows and clears the array
  }

  sendToMainWindow(channel: string, message: any) {
    // Sends a message to the main window
  }
}
export default WindowManager;
```

This code segment outlines the structure and implementation of the WindowManager. Key points include:

- **Window Settings Configuration:** The `windowSettings` object defines common properties for the windows, such as being frameless, transparent, always on top, and fullscreen. These settings are crucial for creating overlay or utility windows that require specific behaviors.

- **Window Creation Methods:** `createMainWindow` and `createCaptureWindows` illustrate how the WindowManager centralizes the creation of different types of windows. This setup allows for a modular and organized approach to window management.

- **Lifecycle Management:** Methods like `restoreOrCreateMainWindow` and `closeCaptureWindow` demonstrate the WindowManager's role in managing the lifecycle of windows, ensuring they are appropriately handled during the application's runtime.

- **Data Transmission:** The method `sendToMainWindow` exemplifies how the WindowManager can facilitate communication between windows, highlighting its capability to streamline data flow across the application.

In summary, the WindowManager's architecture and functionalities are meticulously designed to address the complexities of managing multiple windows in Electron applications. By centralizing window management, enhancing data flow, and ensuring efficient lifecycle management, the WindowManager significantly improves the maintainability and scalability of Electron applications.
### Technical Underpinnings

At its heart, WindowManager leverages Electron's robust APIs, including `BrowserWindow`, `screen`, and `desktopCapturer`, to orchestrate window operations. It introduces a standardized method for window creation, equipped with predefined settings for frameless, always-on-top, and kiosk-mode windows, thereby abstracting the complexities of window configuration.

### Modularization and Reusability

The modular design of WindowManager not only enhances the application's architectural integrity but also promotes reusability and scalability. By abstracting window management into a dedicated class, we pave the way for a more organized and maintainable codebase.

## Integrating WindowManager into Your Project

Integrating WindowManager into an existing Electron project is straightforward. It begins with defining the `WindowManager` class, followed by importing this module into your main process file (`index.ts`). This setup centralizes window-related logic, making it easily accessible and modifiable across the application.

### Practical Implementation

- **Creating Main and Capture Windows:** WindowManager simplifies the creation of various types of windows, including the main application window and specialized capture windows for screen recording or other purposes.
- **Data Management:** It provides a streamlined approach for managing data flow between windows, significantly easing the development of feature-rich, interactive applications.

## Reaping the Benefits

Adopting WindowManager brings a plethora of benefits to Electron application development:

- **Enhanced Maintainability:** Centralizing window management logic drastically reduces the complexity and overhead associated with maintaining multiple windows, leading to a more manageable and error-resistant codebase.
- **Scalability:** With a modular approach, WindowManager enables the application to scale more gracefully, accommodating additional windows or complex workflows with minimal friction.
- **Improved Performance and Reliability:** By optimizing window lifecycle and data management processes, WindowManager contributes to a smoother, more reliable user experience.

## Conclusion

The journey from individual window management to a centralized WindowManager epitomizes the evolution of application architecture in the Electron ecosystem. This approach not only mitigates the challenges of managing multiple windows but also elevates the overall structure and maintainability of Electron applications. As we continue to explore and refine this paradigm, the WindowManager stands as a testament to the power of thoughtful architectural design in software development.
