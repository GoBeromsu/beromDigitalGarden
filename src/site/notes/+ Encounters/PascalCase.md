# PascalCase

PascalCase, also known as Upper Camel Case, is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized.
This includes the first letter of the first word, and there are no intervening spaces or punctuation.

Here's an example to illustrate:

`ThisIsPascalCase`

It's commonly used in many programming languages like C#, Java, etc., particularly for naming classes, objects or methods.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
In this example, `HelloWorld` is written in PascalCase.

The main benefit of using PascalCase is improved readability. By capitalizing each word, it becomes easier to distinguish where one word ends and the next begins.
